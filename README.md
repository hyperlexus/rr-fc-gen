# rr-fc-gen
generates all possible fcs with all pids

# you need 26gb of space and like 12gb of ram!!!!

## how to use:
- run [main.py](main.py)
- wait for like 10 minutes
- run [combine_chunks.py](combine_chunks.py) when done, takes like 3 minutes
- delete data_chunk_1 - data_chunk_100.json
- put a regex pattern at the bottom of [pattern_finder.py](pattern_finder.py)
- wait like 3 minutes for matches
- find them in matches.json :)
